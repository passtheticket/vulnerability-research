# Exploit Title: Asp.Net Zero v12.3.0 - HTML Injection Leads To Open Redirect via Websockets
# Exploit Author: Metin Yunus Kandemir
# Vendor Homepage: https://aspnetzero.com/
# Software Link: https://aspnetzero.com/
# Version: Asp.Net Zero < v12.3.0


# Description:
An open redirect through HTML injection in user messages in Asp.Net before 12.3.0 allows remote attackers to redirect
targeted victims to any URL via the '<meta http-equiv="refresh"' in the WebSocket messages.

# Proof Of Concept
As a concept, messages are transmitted with websockets. A user can redirect the victim user to an arbitrary URL through a message.
1. Send following as message to targeted online user:

<META HTTP-EQUIV="refresh" Â»
CONTENT="0;url=https://target-url/">

2. The redirection is triggered without interaction when the message sent by the attacker appears on the victim user's dashboard.
