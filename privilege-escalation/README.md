# Intel(r) Management and Security Application 5.2 - User Notification Service Unquoted Service Path

Intel(r) Management and Security Application User Notification Service (v5.2) path contains spaces and is not surrounded 
by quotation marks and Windows has to guess where to find the UNS executable that starts automatically.

Windows will first consider the space at the end of the filename and interpret everything.
