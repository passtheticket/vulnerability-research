# ADManager Plus Build 7180 - Recovery Password Disclosure - ZVE-2023-0176
There is a recovery option that helps to restore objects in the domain. When deleted user accounts are restored, default or edited password is set to the user accounts.
Helpdesk technician that has not privilege for backup/recovery operations can view the password and then compromise restored user accounts conducting password spraying attack.

Proof of Concept
1. Login as a helpdesk technician that has not privilege over backup/recovery.
2. Go to the URL https://target/ConfigureRecoverySettings/GET_PASS?req= {"domainId"%3A"1"}

3. The password of other domains (if it is set) can be viewed changing req parameter value such as {"domainId":"2"}
